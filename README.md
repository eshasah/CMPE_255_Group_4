## Project title

Predicting food poisoning and Restaurant Success. ([Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset))

## Project description

Using Yelp restaurant reviews to classify restaurant businesses that are most likely to cause food
poisoning to customers. Business attributes such as ratings, ambience, user reviews etc. are
used to predict the risk of food poisoning at a restaurant.
Certain words that can be used to describe food poisoning and sickness will be searched in the
user reviews and corresponding business(restaurant) will be tagged as a high risk restaurant.
For predicting any restaurant’s success, we will be using attributes such as ratings, longitude,
latitude, category and operational hours from “business.json” to get some idea about which
category of restaurant is still operational at a certain location. With this insight we can predict
whether a restaurant there with similar features will be successful or not in future.

## Purpose

If a restaurant starts getting frequent reviews with food poisoning cases, inspection can be done
to find out the cause and take appropriate action against the restaurant.
When a restaurateur decides to open a restaurant the model will help him to decide whether a
particular type of restaurant will be successful at a particular location. Huge restaurant chains can
use this model to predict which type of restaurant will be more successful in which location.
